Hello!

We are really excited to announce that Glos Care Informatics will be launching
this November.

Our first event will be on November 12th from 19:00 - 21:00 (venue TBC) and then
usually on the 2nd Tuesday of the month onwards.

I hope to be able to announce our first speakers shortly but we are a community so
if there are people you want to hear from please let us know and we'll invite them.

Stay tuned for more information coming soon.
