We are a welcoming community and invite any interested health and care staff to
join us. Some of us have professional roles and responsibilities for informatics
in our day jobs and other are interested in finding out more.

We welcome students and trainees as well, all we ask is politeness and commitment
to attend if you book to one of our events or give us as much notice as possible
if you are unable.

Many thanks,

Glos Care Informatics
